# Array vs ArrayList in Java

This Java project demonstrates the fundamental differences between arrays and ArrayLists, showcasing operations like initialization, addition, modification, and deletion of elements. It's designed as a practice project to help understand these core data structures in Java.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `ArrayVsArrayList.java`.
3. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac ArrayVsArrayList.java`.
4. Run the compiled class with: `java ArrayVsArrayList`.

## Features

- Demonstrates the use of fixed-size arrays and dynamic ArrayLists.
- Examples of initializing, adding to, modifying, and removing elements from both data structures.
- Illustrates how to iterate over arrays and ArrayLists.

This project is intended for practice and learning purposes. Feel free to explore and modify the examples to gain a deeper understanding of working with arrays and ArrayLists in Java.
